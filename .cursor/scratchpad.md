# Xeet Admin Platform - Implementation Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a comprehensive admin platform for Xeet to manage research, analytics, leaderboards, and operational settings. This platform will serve both internal operators and external clients with self-serve capabilities for brand profiles, campaigns, billing, and team access.

### Key Requirements

- **Atomic Design First**: Components must work perfectly at both atom and galaxy scale
- Modular, scalable admin platform supporting large datasets
- Built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- Custom dark theme: https://tweakcn.com/r/themes/cmfjy3fkn000j04ie3smpa8cq
- Minimal and tasteful Framer Motion animations
- Comprehensive research workflows with live feeds and scoring transparency
- Public/private leaderboards with embedding capabilities
- Robust mock data generation for testing

## Atomic Design Philosophy

**Most Important Principle**: Every component must work flawlessly from the smallest atomic level to the largest galactic scale.

### Design System Hierarchy

```
üåå Galaxy    - Complete application ecosystems
üåü Systems   - Feature-complete modules (Research Hub, Leaderboards)
üèõÔ∏è  Templates - Page layouts and complex compositions
üß¨ Organisms - Complex UI components (DataTable, ChartBuilder)
üî¨ Molecules - Simple UI components (SearchBox, FilterChip)
‚öõÔ∏è  Atoms     - Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Icon)
```

### Atomic Design Principles

1. **Atoms**: Fundamental building blocks that cannot be broken down further
   - Must work in isolation with zero dependencies
   - Should handle all possible states (loading, error, disabled, etc.)
   - Perfect accessibility and keyboard navigation
   - Example: Button, Input, Badge, Icon

2. **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms with specific purpose
   - Composed of 2-5 atoms maximum
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Reusable across different contexts
   - Example: SearchBox (Input + Button), FilterChip (Badge + CloseButton)

3. **Organisms**: Complex components serving specific business functions
   - Can contain multiple molecules and atoms
   - Feature-complete and functional
   - Handle their own data and state management
   - Example: DataTable, ChartBuilder, ScoreInspector

4. **Templates**: Page-level layouts without content
   - Define page structure and component placement
   - Responsive and accessible layout patterns
   - No business logic, only structural composition
   - Example: DashboardTemplate, ListPageTemplate

5. **Systems**: Complete feature modules
   - Full user workflows and functionality
   - Handle all edge cases and error states
   - Performance optimized for scale
   - Example: Research Hub, Leaderboard Management

6. **Galaxy**: The entire application ecosystem
   - Seamless integration between all systems
   - Global state management and routing
   - Performance across 500k+ records
   - Cross-system data flow and consistency

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Atomic Design**: Components must scale from individual atoms to galaxy-level complexity
2. **Scale**: Must handle 500k+ posts, 1.9M signal events, 493k users efficiently
3. **Real-time**: Live feed updates with <2s latency from ingest to UI
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Org-scoped data routing and context switching
5. **Performance**: Initial TTI <3s, table interactions <250ms for 100k rows
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard-first navigation
7. **Modularity**: Atomic component architecture enabling infinite scalability

## Lessons

### Terminal Command Hanging Prevention (Critical 2024):
- **NEVER run `npx storybook dev` or long-running dev servers in terminal commands**
- **NEVER make complex config changes without testing incrementally** 
- **ALWAYS use `--help` or `--version` flags first to test command availability**
- **ALWAYS use `timeout` or `&` for any potentially long-running commands**
- **ALWAYS kill processes cleanly**: `pkill -f process_name` not `killall`
- **Test config changes by reading files, not running servers**
- **Use build commands (`npm run build-storybook`) instead of dev servers for testing**

### Storybook Build Hanging Issues (Fixed 2024):
- **Root Cause**: Mixed import patterns cause webpack module resolution conflicts during build
- **Specific Issues Found**:
  1. Direct file imports (`from '../atoms/button'`) instead of index imports (`from '../atoms'`)
  2. Mixed absolute (`@/components`) and relative imports in story files
  3. Inconsistent import paths causing circular dependency detection issues
- **Solution Strategy**:
  1. Always use index imports for atomic design levels: `from '../atoms'`, `from '../molecules'`
  2. Use consistent relative imports in story files, avoid absolute `@/components` imports
  3. Fix all import issues systematically before running Storybook
- **Prevention**: Use ESLint rules to enforce consistent import patterns
- **Quick Fix**: `grep -r "from '\.\./atoms/[a-z]" src/` to find problematic imports

## Lessons

### Technical Decisions

**Storybook Configuration Conflicts** (Fixed 2024):
- Never have both `preview.ts` and `preview.tsx` files simultaneously
- Storybook will get confused about which configuration to use, causing infinite loading
- Always use consistent file extensions across all Storybook config files
- Prefer `.tsx` for preview files when using JSX components in decorators

**Storybook Container Layout Issues** (Fixed 2024):
- Avoid `min-h-screen` in global decorators - causes layout issues in Storybook canvas
- Create responsive containers that adapt to story layout parameters (centered vs non-centered)
- Use `context.parameters.layout` to conditionally adjust container styling
- Centered layouts need `flex items-center justify-center` for proper component positioning

- Using Next.js 14+ with App Router for better performance and SEO
- shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Mock data with @faker-js/faker for realistic testing

### Atomic Design Strategy

- **Atoms**: Start with shadcn/ui foundation, enhance with all states and perfect accessibility
- **Molecules**: Compose 2-5 atoms maximum, single responsibility, reusable everywhere
- **Organisms**: Complex business logic components, feature-complete, handle own data/state
- **Templates**: Page layouts without content, responsive, structural composition only
- **Systems**: Complete feature modules, full workflows, performance optimized
- **Galaxy**: Entire application ecosystem, seamless integration, global state
- Every atomic component documented in Storybook with all variants
- Prioritize atomic composition over inheritance
- Test each component level independently and in composition

### Performance Optimizations

- Virtualization for tables >1k rows
- Cursor pagination for all lists
- Debounced search inputs (300ms)
- Server-side filtering and sorting
- Lazy loading for heavy components

### Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Focus management in modals/drawers
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

## Notes on shadcn Dark Theme

The custom dark theme URL (https://tweakcn.com/r/themes/cmfjy3fkn000j04ie3smpa8cq) should be applied after initial shadcn setup. This will provide consistent dark mode styling across all atomic components. No light mode toggle needed - dark theme only for the entire galaxy-scale application.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Atomic First**: Start with perfect atoms, then compose into molecules, organisms, templates, systems, and galaxy
2. **Build Up**: Never build a larger component without perfecting smaller ones first
3. **Mock Everything**: Use mock data at every atomic level for parallel development
4. **Component Driven**: Build and perfect each atomic level before moving up
5. **Test Atomically**: Test each component level independently and in all compositions
6. **Scale Testing**: Ensure components work at both atom scale and galaxy scale
7. **Document Atomically**: Storybook documentation for every atomic level
8. **Iterate Up**: Get atoms perfect, then molecules perfect, then organisms, etc.
9. **Galaxy Thinking**: Every decision must consider galaxy-scale implications
